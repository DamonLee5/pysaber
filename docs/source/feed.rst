Feedback
========

This software is under development and may have bugs. If you run into any problems, please raise a issue on github at the link `issues <https://github.com/LLNL/pysaber/issues>`_. There is a lot of scope to improve the performance and functionality of this python package. Furthermore, since this package solves a non-convex optimization problem, there is a remote possibility that the final solution may be a local optima that does not properly fit the data. If there is sufficient interest, we will invest time to significantly reduce the run time, improve convergence and usability, and add additional features and functionalities.
